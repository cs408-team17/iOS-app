# WeGroup

## Problem Statement
Nowadays group messaging applications play an important role in everyone’s daily life. A problem arises where a group chat with too many people can get messy and unorganized. It takes time to read through all the messages but the fact is not all of them matter. 

**WeGroup** is an iOS mobile application that allows users to have a more organized group chat by creating branches (or “topics”) inside the conversation, so that it’s easier for users to find what people talked about on the topics that they are interested in.
